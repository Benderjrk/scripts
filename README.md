Best way to use these scripts is to *read them*, grab them and put them
into your own stuff. ***For personal scripts only***, I've given in and
started using the incredibly inefficient and insecure `/usr/bin/env`
she-bang line convention, which pretty much ensures they will work on most any OS and distro.
